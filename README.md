#increase_brightness.asm 

reads an input file of type ppm , processes values by icrementing them by 10, and writes the modified values to the output file, also calculates the average pixels of the olde and new image.

#greyscale.asm
reads an input ppm image, calculates the average pixel, saves the results making it a greyscale. it calculates the average of RGB values for every pixel and makes an image with those values

**usage**
1. ensure qtspim is setup to run mips assembly code
2. write the inputfile using its absolute path
/********IMPORTANT NOTE************/
3. create the output file first before running the code as running it without doing this will not write it anywhere
/****these programmes will just write not create**/
4. write the path of the created output file on the output_file variable
5. reinitialize and load file name:increase_brightness.asm or greyscale.asm
6. run program

/*******POINTS TO NOTE***********/
1. a windows 10 operating system was used to develop the above code
2. the files ending with **-lf.asm** e.g tree_64_in_ascii_lf.ppm were the ones used
